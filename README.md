# Sailor
Ahoy, Sailor! Drop your anchor and board our ship. We've got a theme for you to plunder.

Sailor is a modern, lightweight theme designed to work with Anchor CMS; why you may ask? Simply because Anchor CMS is possibly the best CMS I've ever used and as such it should have a vast library of amazing themes, or so you'd think. Due to Anchor sailing in the shadow of other CMS's like October and Wordpress, it appears like not too many developers have made themes for it. In this case, anchor needs momentum, so smaller = faster right? Definitely! That's why when designing this theme I intended to make it as lightweight as possible and by only using styles that were required.

> Inspiration for this design came from the Anchor Docs and other online blog's I've been to. Not to mention that some of the code styles came from my experience with Github.

Anyway, you can view a live demo of ![Sailor](https://rossmacphee.com/Sailor/themes/sailor/img/logo.png) on my website which is located here: [Live Demo, woo hoo!](https://rossmacphee.com/Sailor/)!

So, some thing's you may be wonder are as follows:
> Uhhhh, how do I remove that Sailor logo (But who'd want to do that, am I right?)

Firstly head over to this theme's image folder, located in "{Base_Folder}/themes/Sailor/img/". Next, you'll want to replace the file called "logo.png" with your own logo!

> What are the dimensions of the logo?

The dimensions of the logo are 22x22px, yes yes, I know it's small, but the smaller the better right?!; Don't forget, dynamically resizing images through "max-width" means increased loading time and mobile users along with Google hate Dynamic people, so don't be _that_ guy!

> How many markdown shortcuts does this support?

We support all shorthand styles so that includes, _italics_, **bold text**, tables and everything else under the sun, except coloured code blocks because that'd require a more advanced pre-processor and themes don't control this.
